This non‑parametric, randomization‑based approach does not assume normality and is robust to outliers or heterogeneous country‑level data.\n\nObserved quantity:The 2020 difference in group means (Asia minus Other), computed from nearly all countries with available life‑expectancy estimates; this is treated as the realized population gap for that year.\nNull distribution: Generated by randomly shuffling the Asia/Other labels across countries and recomputing this difference 1,000 times, representing a hypothetical world in which region has no association with life expectancy and any Asia–Other gap arises purely from random label assignment.\nEmpirical p‑value: The proportion of simulated differences whose absolute value is at least as large as the absolute observed difference, corresponding to a two‑sided test of “no difference” versus “different.”\n\n\n\nDescription of functions\nA custom function, diff_in_means(), computes the difference in mean life expectancy between Asian and non‑Asian countries (Asia minus Other) for a given dataset. A second function, perm_step(), performs one permutation step by shuffling the region labels, recalculating this difference, and returning both the observed and permuted values. This permutation step is repeated 1,000 times using a mapping routine to generate a null sampling distribution of the difference in means under the assumption that region and life expectancy are unrelated.\nThe empirical p‑value is then calculated as the proportion of permuted differences whose absolute value is at least as large as the absolute observed difference, providing a two‑sided measure of how strongly the data contradict the null hypothesis that mean life expectancy is the same in Asian and non‑Asian countries."

    "text": "Results and Visualization\n\nResults Interpretation:\nThe observed difference in mean life expectancy between Asia and other regions in 2020 is about 1.17 years, with Asia having the higher average. Under the null hypothesis that region (Asia vs Other) has no effect on life expectancy, about 29.1% of the permuted datasets produced a difference in means at least as large as this observed gap in absolute value. In other words, if the labels “Asia” and “Other” were really random with respect to life expectancy, a gap as large as 1.17 years would appear in roughly 3 out of 10 permutations purely by chance. Because this two‑sided p‑value (0.291) is much larger than a typical significance level such as 0.05, the observed Asia–Other difference is not unusually large relative to the null distribution, so the permutation test provides little evidence against the null hypothesis that mean life expectancy is the same in Asian and non‑Asian countries in 2020.\nLooking across earlier years, Asia’s mean life expectancy from 2015 to 2019 was consistently about 1.3–1.5 years higher than that of non‑Asian countries. The 2020 gap of 1.17 years is slightly smaller but of similar magnitude, indicating that the Asia–Other difference in the first pandemic year is broadly consistent with recent pre‑pandemic patterns rather than representing a dramatic new divergence.\n\n\nFigure 1.

The medians and interquartile ranges are similar, and the ranges overlap substantially, indicating that typical life expectancy levels are comparable between Asian and non‑Asian countries rather than dramatically different in this year.\n\n\nFigure 2.

The red dashed line marks the observed 2020 gap of about 1.17 years. Because this observed value lies well inside the main bulk of the permuted differences, it is not unusually large under the null model where region is unrelated to life expectancy, consistent with a two‑sided permutation p‑value of approximately 0.29.\n\n\nFigure 3.

Asia’s average life expectancy is consistently about 1.3–1.5 years higher than that of other regions before the pandemic, and the 2020 gap of 1.17 years is slightly smaller but similar in magnitude, suggesting that the first pandemic year did not create a qualitatively new divergence between Asia and the rest of the world."

    "text": "In 2015, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, a large public hospital group within the United Kingdom’s tax‑funded National Health Service (NHS), partnered with Google DeepMind, an artificial‑intelligence lab owned by Alphabet, to develop Streams, a smartphone app intended to alert clinicians in real time when patients showed signs of acute kidney injury. To build and test Streams, DeepMind received access to the medical records of approximately 1.6 million NHS patients, including highly sensitive information such as HIV status, mental health history, and drug‑use data. (Powles & Hodson, 2017).\nWhat began as a promising digital‑health initiative quickly became one of the UK’s most controversial data‑science collaborations when it emerged that patients had not been told their records would be shared with a private company and had not consented to this use. In 2017, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the national regulator for data‑protection and privacy, concluded that the partnership violated data‑protection law because the data had been shared under the justification of “direct patient care,” even though Streams was still being tested and was not yet part of routine care.(University of Cambridge, 2019).\nThis partnership became a defining example of how ethics, power, and corporate interests intersect in artificial intelligence research. It showed that technological innovation in healthcare cannot be separated from the moral questions surrounding ownership, consent, and the use of personal data."

    "text": "1. Consent and Permission Structures\nQuestions addressed: What was the permission structure for using the data? Was it followed? What was the consent structure for patients? Were they aware of how their data would be used? Is informed consent possible for unforeseen future applications?\nUnder the UK Data Protection Act, organizations must have a valid legal basis for processing personal data. The Royal Free Trust argued that sharing data with DeepMind was justified under “direct patient care,” the same basis that allows clinicians to access records to diagnose and treat individuals. However, Streams was in a research and testing phase; patients were not yet receiving care through the app, so this legal justification did not apply.\nIn 2017, the ICO found that the Royal Free Trust had failed to adequately inform patients about the partnership or the ways their data would be processed. Patients were not told that a private AI lab would receive their records, nor were they given a meaningful chance to opt in or out. Genuine informed consent requires that people know who will access their data, for what purposes, and with what potential consequences. In this case, patients had no realistic way to understand that their records might support algorithm development, later products, or broader commercial AI strategies.\nMore broadly, the case highlights the limits of conventional consent models in big‑data healthcare. Fan, Zhang, and Li (2025) argue that when AI enables open‑ended reuse of data, future applications are often impossible to foresee at the point of collection. The DeepMind collaboration demonstrates how quickly clinical data, obtained for treatment and operations, can be repurposed for research and development far beyond what patients initially understood."

    "text": "2. Data Privacy and Identifiability\nQuestions addressed: Is the data identifiable? Are parts of it sufficiently anonymized to avoid ethical concerns? Is anonymity realistically guaranteed?\nDeepMind received rich, line‑level health records from the Royal Free, including names, addresses, dates, and detailed medical histories. Although the organizations stressed that the data were stored and processed securely, the ICO concluded that the scale and identifiability of the dataset went well beyond what was necessary for testing Streams.\nEven where explicit identifiers are removed, true anonymity in health data is difficult to achieve. Murdoch (2021) notes that combinations of diagnoses, dates, demographics, and geography can re‑identify individuals when linked with other datasets. A small set of quasi‑identifiers, such as age, postcode, and rare conditions, can be enough to single out a person.\nIn the Streams case, DeepMind’s access to identifiable or easily re‑identifiable records without explicit patient consent represented a clear privacy risk. It exposed weaknesses in data‑governance processes around data minimization (only using what is strictly necessary), independent oversight, and clarity about who is accountable when public providers share health records with private AI developers."

    "text": "3. Representation and Bias in Algorithm Design\nQuestions addressed: Who was measured? Are these patients representative of the broader populations where the algorithm might be used? Should we analyze data if we know the sample is narrow?\nThe training data for Streams came from a single hospital trust in London, which limited the demographic and clinical diversity of the dataset. Algorithms built on such a narrow population may not perform well for patients in other regions, health‑system contexts, or with different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.\nDankwa‑Mullan et al. (2024) emphasize that AI tools trained on unrepresentative data can reproduce and intensify existing health inequities, especially when they are deployed at scale without rigorous external validation. D’Ignazio and Klein’s (2020) Data Feminism framework similarly stresses examining who is included and excluded in a dataset, and how those choices reflect existing power structures and systemic bias.\nBecause Streams was trained primarily on patients from one trust, its fairness and reliability for other NHS populations were uncertain from the outset. Yet the project attracted national and international attention as a model of “AI for healthcare,” illustrating how quickly tools based on local data can be implicitly generalized to much broader contexts."

    "section": "4. Data Use Beyond Original Intent",
    "text": "4. Data Use Beyond Original Intent\nQuestion addressed: Is the data being used in ways that go beyond the purposes for which it was originally collected?\nThe NHS collects patient records to deliver care, manage services, and meet legal obligations, not to provide a general data resource for private AI labs. In the DeepMind partnership, however, information originally gathered for clinical purposes was repurposed to develop and test a machine‑learning system owned by a subsidiary of a large technology company.\nDeepMind described Streams as a non‑commercial patient‑safety project, but Alphabet nonetheless benefited from technical expertise, infrastructure, and potential intellectual property generated through the collaboration. Fan et al. (2025) argue that in such arrangements, public institutions often provide the data while private firms capture most of the long‑term value in the form of algorithms, know‑how, and future products. Patients whose data made the work possible rarely participate in decisions about reuse and typically do not share in any commercial benefits.\nFrom a Data Feminism perspective, this reflects a structural power imbalance between public healthcare systems and corporate technology actors. Public providers depend on large technology firms for AI tools and infrastructure, while those firms gain influence over public infrastructure through control of data and models. The Streams case shows how easily public health data can be drawn into private research agendas once consent and governance safeguards fail."

    "text": "5. Why It Matters\nQuestions addressed: “Who benefits? Who is neglected or harmed? Were the ethical violations in the interest of profit, surveillance, or power?”\nIn principle, tools like Streams can improve patient outcomes by flagging kidney injury earlier and helping clinicians intervene more quickly. In practice, the way this collaboration was structured concentrated benefits and risks unevenly. Alphabet gained access to a large, high‑quality dataset and an opportunity to develop AI capabilities in a high‑profile clinical setting. Patients, by contrast, lost control over sensitive information and were exposed to privacy risks without their knowledge or consent.\nBecause the data came from one trust and patients had no role in governance, the project also risked reinforcing inequities; improving care for some groups while leaving others unserved or mis‑served. As D’Ignazio and Klein (2020) argue, ethical data science is not only about meeting legal requirements; it also demands attention to fairness, accountability, and the protection of those with the least power.\nThe DeepMind–Royal Free case ultimately serves as a cautionary tale. Inadequate consent, insufficient anonymization, narrow training data, and repurposing of patient records for corporate AI development all reveal how easily technological innovation can outpace ethical and regulatory safeguards. Without stronger consent mechanisms, transparent governance, more representative data, and fair sharing of benefits, AI in healthcare risks reproducing the very power imbalances and inequities it claims to address."

    "text": "Conclusion\nUsing SQL to aggregate the Stanford Open Policing Project statewide tables for Colorado, Connecticut, and Illinois, this analysis compares both the volume of stops and the likelihood of searches by subject sex.\n\nStop volume: Across all three states, male drivers are stopped substantially more often than female drivers, with particularly large absolute numbers in Illinois. This implies that men experience more direct contact with traffic enforcement, which could stem from greater time spent driving, differences in vehicle use, or sex-focused patterns in enforcement focus.\nSearch rates: In Connecticut and Illinois, male drivers also have higher search rates than female drivers, meaning that conditional on being stopped, men are more likely to be searched. Colorado, in contrast, has low search rates for both groups and only a slight sex difference, consistent with state‑specific policies or practices that limit searches.\n\nTogether, these results indicate that sex differences in traffic stops are multidimensional: men in these data face both higher exposure (more stops) and, in some states, more intrusive outcomes (higher search rates). At the same time, the differences across states highlight that these patterns are shaped by local practices and legal environments, underscoring the value of multi‑state data for separating broad structural trends from jurisdiction‑specific policies."

Asia, by contrast, appears over‑represented relative to other regions in raw counts, raising questions about how selection, coverage, and BBC editorial choices shape which women and regions receive global recognition.\nHow does the field of achievement (category) vary by region?\nIn every region except Oceania, women are spread across all four BBC categories (Leadership, Knowledge, Identity, Creativity), but the mix differs by region. Asia and Africa have particularly large “Knowledge” and “Leadership” segments, whereas the Americas show a more even balance between Leadership, Knowledge, and Identity, with a smaller Creativity segment."
