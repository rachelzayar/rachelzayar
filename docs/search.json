This non‑parametric, randomization‑based approach does not assume normality and is robust to outliers or heterogeneous country‑level data.\n\nObserved quantity:The 2020 difference in group means (Asia minus Other), computed from nearly all countries with available life‑expectancy estimates; this is treated as the realized population gap for that year.\nNull distribution: Generated by randomly shuffling the Asia/Other labels across countries and recomputing this difference 1,000 times, representing a hypothetical world in which region has no association with life expectancy and any Asia–Other gap arises purely from random label assignment.\nEmpirical p‑value: The proportion of simulated differences whose absolute value is at least as large as the absolute observed difference, corresponding to a two‑sided test of “no difference” versus “different.”\n\n\n\nDescription of functions\nA custom function, diff_in_means(), computes the difference in mean life expectancy between Asian and non‑Asian countries (Asia minus Other) for a given dataset. A second function, perm_step(), performs one permutation step by shuffling the region labels, recalculating this difference, and returning both the observed and permuted values. This permutation step is repeated 1,000 times using a mapping routine to generate a null sampling distribution of the difference in means under the assumption that region and life expectancy are unrelated.\nThe empirical p‑value is then calculated as the proportion of permuted differences whose absolute value is at least as large as the absolute observed difference, providing a two‑sided measure of how strongly the data contradict the null hypothesis that mean life expectancy is the same in Asian and non‑Asian countries."

    "text": "Results and Visualization\n\nResults Interpretation:\nThe observed difference in mean life expectancy between Asia and other regions in 2020 is about 1.17 years, with Asia having the higher average. Under the null hypothesis that region (Asia vs Other) has no effect on life expectancy, about 29.1% of the permuted datasets produced a difference in means at least as large as this observed gap in absolute value. In other words, if the labels “Asia” and “Other” were really random with respect to life expectancy, a gap as large as 1.17 years would appear in roughly 3 out of 10 permutations purely by chance. Because this two‑sided p‑value (0.291) is much larger than a typical significance level such as 0.05, the observed Asia–Other difference is not unusually large relative to the null distribution, so the permutation test provides little evidence against the null hypothesis that mean life expectancy is the same in Asian and non‑Asian countries in 2020.\nLooking across earlier years, Asia’s mean life expectancy from 2015 to 2019 was consistently about 1.3–1.5 years higher than that of non‑Asian countries. The 2020 gap of 1.17 years is slightly smaller but of similar magnitude, indicating that the Asia–Other difference in the first pandemic year is broadly consistent with recent pre‑pandemic patterns rather than representing a dramatic new divergence.\n\n\nFigure 1.

The medians and interquartile ranges are similar, and the ranges overlap substantially, indicating that typical life expectancy levels are comparable between Asian and non‑Asian countries rather than dramatically different in this year.\n\n\nFigure 2.

The red dashed line marks the observed 2020 gap of about 1.17 years. Because this observed value lies well inside the main bulk of the permuted differences, it is not unusually large under the null model where region is unrelated to life expectancy, consistent with a two‑sided permutation p‑value of approximately 0.29.\n\n\nFigure 3.

Asia’s average life expectancy is consistently about 1.3–1.5 years higher than that of other regions before the pandemic, and the 2020 gap of 1.17 years is slightly smaller but similar in magnitude, suggesting that the first pandemic year did not create a qualitatively new divergence between Asia and the rest of the world."

    "text": "In 2015, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust partnered with Google DeepMind, a branch of Alphabet Inc., to create an artificial intelligence system called Streams. The goal was to develop a smartphone app that could alert doctors in real time if a patient showed signs of acute kidney injury. To make this possible, DeepMind received access to the medical records of 1.6 million NHS patients, including sensitive information such as HIV status, mental health history, and drug-use data (Powles & Hodson, 2017).\nWhat began as a promising step forward in digital healthcare soon turned into one of the most controversial data science cases in the United Kingdom. It was revealed that patients were never told their data had been shared, nor had they given permission. In 2017, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office ruled that the partnership had violated data protection laws because the data were shared under the claim of “direct patient care,” even though the Streams app was still being tested (University of Cambridge, 2019).\nThis partnership became a defining example of how ethics, power, and corporate interests intersect in artificial intelligence research. It showed that technological innovation in healthcare cannot be separated from the moral questions surrounding ownership, consent, and the use of personal data."

    "text": "1. Consent and Permission Structures\nQuestions addressed: “What is the permission structure for using the data? Was it followed?” and “What was the consent structure for recruiting participants? Were the participants aware of the ways their data would be used for research? Was informed consent possible? Can you provide informed consent for applications that are yet foreseen?”\nA major ethical issue in the DeepMind case concerns informed consent. Under the UK’s Data Protection Act, organizations must have a valid legal basis for processing personal data. The Royal Free Trust claimed that its data sharing with DeepMind was justified under the principle of “direct patient care.” However, since Streams was still in the testing phase, patients were not actually receiving care through the app, meaning this justification did not apply (Powles & Hodson, 2017).\nIn 2017, the Information Commissioner’s Office confirmed that the Royal Free Trust had failed to properly inform patients about how their data would be used (University of Cambridge, 2019). This shows that the proper permission structures were not followed. Genuine informed consent requires that individuals clearly understand how their data will be used and voluntarily agree to that use. In this case, patients were unaware that a private technology company would access their records or that their data could later contribute to commercial artificial intelligence development.\nThis situation reveals a broader challenge within artificial intelligence research. Once data are collected, they can easily be reused for purposes that were not anticipated at the time of collection. Fan, Zhang, and Li (2025) argue that informed consent becomes almost impossible when the potential uses of data extend far beyond their original intent."

    "text": "2. Data Privacy and Identifiability\nQuestions addressed: “Is the data identifiable? All of it? Some of it? In what way? Are the data sufficiently anonymized or old to be free of ethical concerns? Is anonymity guaranteed?”\nDeepMind’s access to NHS data also created serious privacy concerns. The dataset included identifiable details such as names, addresses, and full medical histories (Powles & Hodson, 2017). Although both DeepMind and the NHS stated that the data were securely processed, the Information Commissioner’s Office found that the level of identifiability went far beyond what was necessary for the algorithm’s development (University of Cambridge, 2019).\nEven when data are anonymized, complete anonymity in healthcare records is very difficult to achieve. Murdoch (2021) explains that health data often contain unique combinations of variables that make it possible to re-identify individuals through cross-referencing with other data sources. For instance, combining medical history with demographic details such as age and postal code can easily point to a specific person.\nIn this case, DeepMind’s access to identifiable patient data without explicit consent represented a clear breach of privacy. It also exposed weaknesses in data governance and demonstrated the need for stronger safeguards, greater oversight, and clearer definitions of ownership and accountability in digital healthcare systems."

Are those individuals representative of the people to whom we’d like to generalize or apply the algorithm? Should we analyze data if we do not know how the data were collected?”\nAnother ethical concern in the DeepMind and NHS collaboration was representation bias. The dataset used to train Streams came from a single hospital trust in London, which limited the diversity of the data. Algorithms trained on such narrow datasets may fail to perform accurately across wider populations, especially for individuals with different ethnic, socioeconomic, or geographic backgrounds.\nDankwa-Mullan et al. (2024) argue that when artificial intelligence systems are trained on unrepresentative data, they can reproduce and even amplify existing health inequalities. This means that technology intended to improve care might instead deepen the disparities already present in the system.\nThis issue connects to the framework proposed by D’Ignazio and Klein (2020), which emphasizes examining inclusion and exclusion within datasets. Because the Streams model was trained using data from a limited population, it lacked diversity and fairness by design. As a result, its effectiveness and reliability in broader clinical settings were uncertain."

    "text": "4. Data Use Beyond Original Intent\nQuestions addressed: “Is the data being used in unintended ways to the original study?”\nOne of the most troubling ethical concerns in this case is the use of patient data for purposes that went beyond their original intent. The NHS collected this information to provide medical care, not to support research by a private company. Yet the same data were later used by DeepMind to develop and test an artificial intelligence system.\nAlthough DeepMind claimed the project was not commercial, its parent company, Alphabet, gained valuable expertise and intellectual property through the collaboration (Fan et al., 2025). This raises questions about fairness and transparency, especially when public data become a foundation for private technological advancement.\nThis situation illustrates a larger pattern in data science where public institutions collect vast amounts of data, but private corporations are the ones who benefit most from it. Patients, on the other hand, have little control over how their personal information is used. From the perspective of Data Feminism, this represents an imbalance of power between public organizations and corporate entities. Public healthcare systems rely on large technology firms for innovation, while those firms gain influence and control over public data."

    "text": "5. Why It Matters\nQuestions addressed: “Who benefits? Who is neglected or harmed? Were the ethical violations in the interest of profit, surveillance, or power?”\nThe DeepMind and NHS controversy shows that data science is deeply connected to ethics, governance, and power. The problems of inadequate consent, insufficient anonymization, limited representation, and the repurposing of patient data all reveal a larger issue in modern healthcare: the treatment of personal information as a commodity.\nTechnology companies gain significant advantages from access to extensive datasets that strengthen their algorithms and market influence. Patients, however, lose control over their personal data and may face risks from biased or untested systems.\nAs D’Ignazio and Klein (2020) argue, ethical data science is not only about legal compliance but also about fairness, accountability, and respect for human rights. The DeepMind case highlights the urgent need to center equity and transparency in the development of data-driven healthcare. Without these principles, technological progress risks reinforcing the very inequities it claims to solve."

Using SQL to aggregate the statewide tables, Figure 1 shows that male subjects are stopped substantially more often than female subjects in all three states, with particularly large absolute volumes in Illinois. This pattern suggests that men experience a greater level of direct contact with state-level traffic enforcement, which could reflect differences in driving exposure (e.g., more time spent driving) but may also indicate gendered patterns in enforcement focus.\nFigure 2 reveals that the likelihood of being searched once stopped is also patterned by subject sex, but in a way that varies across states. In Connecticut and Illinois, male subjects have noticeably higher search rates than female subjects, indicating that among those who are stopped, men are more likely to be subjected to a search. Colorado, by contrast, exhibits much lower overall search rates for both groups and only a small difference between male and female subjects, which implies that departmental policies or legal constraints there may limit searches more uniformly.\nTaken together, these results highlight that gender-related disparities in traffic stops are multidimensional: men face both higher exposure (more stops) and, in some jurisdictions, more intrusive outcomes (higher search rates). At the same time, the cross-state differences show that these patterns are not fixed and can vary substantially with local practices, legal standards, or training. These insights underscore the value of multi-state databases like the Stanford Open Policing Project for distinguishing between broad structural patterns (e.g., men being stopped more often) and context-specific policy effects that shape what happens during and after a stop."

    "text": "This analysis examines the frequency and distribution of the word “love” in the dialogue of Romeo and Juliet, identifying which characters use it most often and in what contexts. Its goal is to quantify the term’s explicit usage and trace patterns in how it appears across the play. The project also highlights key moments where “love” is paired with “death,” showing how Shakespeare uses this juxtaposition to reinforce the play’s tragic tone. Specifically, it addresses the following questions:\n\nHow many lines explicitly contain the word “love”?\nWhich characters use the word most frequently?\nIn which lines does Shakespeare pair “love” with “death,” and what might these instances suggest about the play’s tragic tone?"
