However, the empirical p-value from the permutation test is 0.291.\nSince the empirical p-value is 0.291 (much greater than 0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means the observed difference in life expectancy between Asia and the rest of the world could easily have occurred by random chance, so we do not have strong evidence for a real difference in this year.\n\n# Plot: Boxplot of data by region\nggplot(le_dat, aes(x=region, y=LifeExpectancy, fill=region)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancy by Region, 2020\",\n       y = \"Life Expectancy (years)\", x = \"Region\",\n       fill = \"Region\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription for Boxplot: Life Expectancy by Region (2020)\nThis boxplot compares country-level life expectancy across Asia and the rest of the world for the year 2020. The median (middle line) and the central spread (interquartile range) are similar for both groups, with “Other” countries having a slightly higher median. The ranges largely overlap, suggesting that most countries, regardless of region, have comparable average life expectancies. This visual indicates no dramatic difference in life expectancy distribution between Asia and other regions for this year.\n\n# Plot: Permutation test distribution\ntibble(sim_diff = perm_diffs) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = sim_diff)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=0.2, fill=\"grey70\", color=\"black\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=observed_diff, color=\"red\", linetype=\"dashed\", size=1.3) +\n  labs(title = \"Permutation Test: Null Distribution (Asia minus Other, 2020)\",\n       x = \"Permuted difference in means\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermutation Test Null Distribution\nThis histogram shows the distribution of mean life expectancy differences (Asia minus Other) obtained by randomly shuffling region labels 1,000 times—a simulation of what we might expect by chance. The red dashed line marks the actual observed difference between the two regions. Because this observed statistic falls well within the main cluster of the permutation distribution, it suggests that the observed difference is not unusual under the null hypothesis. Thus, we do not have strong statistical evidence to claim a genuine difference in mean life expectancy between Asia and the rest of the world in 2020."
